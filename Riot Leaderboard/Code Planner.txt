==================
  Leaderboard structure
==================

Discord bot will join server and await for someone to add their ign to the Leaderboard.
once it has been added the leaderboard has begun. It will show the players stats in a long format
Example:
      Position        Name         Rank          Winrate         KDA         Total Damage
      ==================================================================================
      1st         Fliperdudole     Gold IV         50%          2.40             355k
      etc
      etc

The bot will accumulate the total damage they have dealt every day up until Monday. Where it will announce the winners in each role by @'ing them



===============
  START UP
===============

When the bot joins a server, it will be on standby until a user uses the command !startleaderboard and it will then save the current day, as the initial day,
and will begin recording the rank, winrate, kda, and total damage dealt, of any user added of any games, with it updating every hour, of that day up until 
11:59pm of that day. once it is 11:59pm it will save all data in a JSON file, which the name of the JSON file will follow this format 
"LoL_LB_month_day_year.json", for each user added and their data. The program will continue recording data of each day and with a new JSON file, but with 
the same user's of the previous JSON file for the respective day and post the daily leaderboard. once it has been a week since the inital day. It will add up 
all the data of the previous days and complete the leaderboard, save a JSON file with the name of the file being "Final_LoL_LB_initial day - final day" and 
post the final leaderboard on discord. It will then start of with the same users and continue.






======================
What I currently have
======================
Discord bot joins -> standby -> Command Track -> gets name -> gets account puuid/name ->gets wr,kda,ttl dmg -> gets rank/lp -> prints


===========================
What I need
===========================
Plan:
Discord bot joins -> standby until !start -> !start saves the initial day, server ID, in a file and tells user about !setleaderboard and continues until !stop
if !start is used but no user in userfile, then notify server that a user needs to be added with !add <name> command before starting.

Check if current day has "LoL_LB_month_day_year.JSON" file, if not create it with user's account name/puuid skeleton file
Once it has started, read users match history every hour, if (match date = current date and match id is not in file "LoL_LB_month_day_year.JSON")
then save match id, wr, kda,ttl dmg, rank/lp to "LoL_LB_month_day_year.JSON" under under user's name, then calculate user's current average stats and saves back to "LoL_LB_month_day_year.JSON" 
if (current tracking date = 11:59pm) then for each server ID in "LoL_LB_month_day_year.JSON" print the leaderboard, which reads the "LoL_LB_month_day_year.JSON" file and organizes user's stats 
by rank in array. Then print array, in that day's "LoL_LB_month_day_year.JSON" file save Leaderboard

if current day = a week after initial day then create  "Final_LoL_LB_initial day - final day.JSON" file, then read all of the previous averages of that week,
calculate new averages then save to "Final_LoL_LB_initial day - final day", then for each Server ID, print out leaderboard by descending rank and @ each winner for each category

once week has been done, start all over with the same existing users.

====================
Commands to use
====================
!start               = saves the initial day, server ID, in a file
!stop                = stop leaderboard tracking for server ID
!setleaderboard      = sets the channel in where the server wants the leaderboard to be
!currentleaderboard  = prints the current averages, but they are not the daily
!add <name>          = gets account puuid/name -> saves name/server ID to userfile for that server's leaderboard
